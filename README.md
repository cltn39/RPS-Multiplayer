# RPS-Multiplayer
Week6_HW_Challenge
-Soon to be multiplayer rock paper scissor game
-Currently set to play against computer
## What I used

this game was built using jQuery& Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, googlefont, fontawesome, and bootstrap.

Data persistency was achieved by firebase.

##Additional features:

- As a user, you can send public messages to others in chatbox. (4/24/2019 update)
- you can now click RPS buttons and image will pop up to represent the button. (4/18/2019 update)

##Upcoming changes:
 Currently game is not ##Multiplayer game, however the feature will be updated as soon as possible.
 Currently chat name is all set to testName and unable to uniquely id messenger. This will be address after multiplayer functionality has been added.
 Viewercount is currently not working, however it will be soon updated.
